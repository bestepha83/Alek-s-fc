                        <p>Our fearless leader, Ben only started his managing career to put on his resume.
                             Turns out he's got a real knack for bossing people around. As a sturdy hitter, 
                            he leads from the front line, setting an example for his underlings. Some historians 
                            suspect William Shakespeare himself based his work off of Ben's pre-game motivational 
                            speeches.

                        <p>
                            Sierra is known by few but feared by all. As the control tower of the team, 
                            Sierra's power sets are famous in the volleyball world. Rumor has it she's never
                             missed a set in her entire life. Like poker, you do not want to play against Sierra's 
                             serve, she only deals aces.

                        <h6>Volleyball Team Mascot</h6>  
                        <p>
                            From his humble beginnings in Seattle, Washington, 
                            Alek Arpe has risen the ranks as the star player of his very own volleyball team.
                            Alek may not the strongest, most athletic, most agile, or adept in any way 
                            towards the volleyball sport. But doggon it he will leave it all on the court 
                            every match. Alek's signature shot is the backrow pipe, a move he's familiar with on and off the court.
                             He is the heart and soul of the team: neither can survive without the other.

                            While his toe may be totaled, never underestimate the sheer power of Kieran Barker.
                            Conventionality was never part of the question for Kieran. Always prowling at the net, you never 
                            know when those massive quads will spring him up into the sky for a monstrous block 
                            sending the ball back into his pitiful opponent's face.
                            His catch phrase is "Oh, very educational."

                            As the token frat boy in the team, his charming demeanor never ceases to amaze.
                            But even better is his quality as an outside hitter. Legend has it, one of his spikes literally killed a dude.
                            Outside of volleyball, you can catch Dom eating dinner or playing dye with his little and grandlittle.

                            Our most talented bench warmer, Holly's enthusiasm always provides results, both on and off the court.
                            Her signature shot is her underhand serve, which catches her opponents off-guard by the loft and velocity it rains down.
                            You will not find a better underhand server or bench shit-talker in the country.

                            Number 4 in command, Ford brings a lot to the table. As the rookie of the team, he has a lot to prove, 
                            but if anybody was ever up to the task, by golly it's Ford. In pre-season practices,
                            Ford was exceeding expectations, giving established star players a run for their money. The volleyball
                            world is excited to see what he does next.
