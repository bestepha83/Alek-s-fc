                            A shocking outcome for the grossly uneven first game of the season for Ramona FC. Following recruitment difficulties for 
                            the legendary club, only 7 players were able to attend the game (one coming very late (Sierra Wohlford)) against the ROTC 
                            fleet of 9, plus a couple reserves for substitutions.<br><br>
        
                            Against all odds and within the first 10 minutes of the game, Spencer Grant shot an outstanding goal to obtain the first goal of 
                            the night. Then, 5 minutes later, another goal. Soon, RFC was unstoppable, scoring two more goals before the half. The crowd (of one) was electric.<br><br>
        
                            At the half, the score was 4-2 favoring RFC. The second half took off at a slow start, RFC having left everything on the field in the 
                            first half, and with no redemption in sight from substitutions. Then, out of left field, Kat Beanie whacked the soccer ball in a textbook cross to Ben Stephan, 
                            who headed the ball straight into the net for his first goal of the season. It was a legendary moment that history won't soon forget.<br><br>
        
                            RFC held on by a thread in the last minutes of the game, score 5-4, with spectacular defense by Alek Arpe, quick feet by Kieran Barker, and 
                            surprising saves by The Wolf herself. The game is seen as one of the most incredible in the history of RFC, and even Ramona Sports Club. 
                            The win is marks the first and certainly not the last of the greatness expected from RFC this season.

                <h2>Alek Arpe's Extraordinary Volleyball Team LOSES</h2>
                <h5>AAEVT suffers heartbreaking defeat to That's What She Set in first match of the IM season</h5>
                <div class = "news-content">

                        <p>Team Mascot Alek Arpe seen training for next volleyball match</p>

                    <div class = "news-text">
                        <p>
                            At the first game of the season, AAEVT suffered a 
                            heartbreaking defeat against their all-time arch-rivals, That's What She Set.<br><br>
        
                            The game was very close indeed. Impressive serves from TWSS and startling shots from AAEVT made 
                            the match a fantastical spectacle for the hordes of AAEVT fans (no TWSS fans were reported in attendance). 
                            Team mother Krista Stephan has this to say, "I've never seen the likes of this before. The ball was moving so quickly 
                            it was nearly indistinguishable. However, despite the impressive performance of my daughter Sarah's team, I still love
                            my son Benjamin and his team much more." In the end, AAEVT Coach Sierra Wohlford (aka, The Wolf) claimed, "We were just 
                            rusty and making too many unforced errors, but now that the rust is off, I'd be surprised if we lose a set ever again."<br><br>
        
                            There are allegations that That's What She Set employed illegal d1 IM players in 
                            order to secure the victory, but when TWSS Team Manager Sarah Stephan was confronted 
                            on the matter, she offered no comment.<br><br>
        
                            While a surprising defeat, AAEVT fans can find comfort in the fact that the team 
                            still retains more wins over That's What She Set: 2-1.
