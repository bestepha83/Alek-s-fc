                <h2>Alek Arpe's Extraordinary Volleyball Team LOSES</h2>
                <h5>AAEVT suffers heartbreaking defeat to That's What She Set in first match of the IM season</h5>
                <p>
                    At the first game of the season, AAEVT suffered a 
                    heartbreaking defeat against their all-time arch-rivals, That's What She Set.<br><br>

                    The game was very close indeed. Impressive serves from TWSS and startling shots from AAEVT made 
                    the match a fantastical spectacle for the hordes of AAEVT fans (no TWSS fans were reported in attendance). 
                    Team mother Krista Stephan has this to say, "I've never seen the likes of this before. The ball was moving so quickly 
                    it was nearly indistinguishable. However, despite the impressive performance of my daughter Sarah's team, I still love
                    my son Benjamin and his team much more." In the end, AAEVT Coach Sierra Wohlford (aka, The Wolf) claimed, "We were just 
                    rusty and making too many unforced errors, but now that the rust is off, I'd be surprised if we lose a set ever again."<br><br>

                    There are allegations that That's What She Set employed illegal d1 IM players in 
                    order to secure the victory, but when TWSS Team Manager Sarah Stephan was confronted 
                    on the matter, she offered no comment.<br><br>

                    While a surprising defeat, AAEVT fans can find comfort in the fact that the team 
                    still retains more wins over That's What She Set: 2-1.
